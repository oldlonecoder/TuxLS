# TuxLS
As a renegade oldlonecoder, here is my own R&amp;D and personnal hobby code legacy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* It is Tuxic code at the opposite of the "standard mainstream". 
* It is full of dangerous (and t'u'xic) raw pointers!
* Does not conform to the modern c++ standards. Using just a little bit of it.
* Abusing usage of std::{vector,string,pair,map,function...}

(  Kind of small [standalone] Framework written in C++ ).
